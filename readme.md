#The Frightened Narrator

- A Web Audio / Web Speech API hybrid that makes a robot speak gibberish if you shout at your computer, otherwise the robot will just read *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* normally.
- Built on examples by [Chris Wilson](https://github.com/cwilso) and [Keith Enevoldsen](http://thinkzone.wlonk.com/Gibber/GibGen.htm)
- Needs a microphone connected to get a volume measurement.
